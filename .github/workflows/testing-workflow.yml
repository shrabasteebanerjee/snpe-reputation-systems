# This workflow will install Python dependencies, run tests and lint with a variety of Python versions
# For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-python
#
# This needs modifications like defining the apprpriate python version and eliminate the flake8 stuff which I understand
# will not be needed.
